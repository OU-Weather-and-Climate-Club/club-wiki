## ðŸ“Œ University of Reading 

The University of Reading is the UK's leading meteorology department and offers 4 short free on-demand courses open to anyone. No existing knowledge or experience of meteorology required:

 - [Come Rain or Shine: Understanding the Weather](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/come-rain-or-shine)
  
*Explore some of the physical processes driving UK weather systems and get hands on in the world of weather with practical activities and fieldwork. Try your hand at forecasting and have a go at interpreting weather maps and compare your results with our educator, Dr Sylvia Knightâ€™s. Youâ€™ll also watch our educators carrying out simple but effective experiments including creating clouds, simulating hot air rising and demonstrating the Coriolis effect*  
   
- [Planet Partners: Tackling the Climate Crisis Together](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/tackling-climate-crisis) 

*Investigate the impact of climate change, the research being done to tackle it, and what you can do to take meaningful action* 
  
- [Dare to Discover Data Assimilation](https://discoverda.org/)

*Data assimilation has potential applications in a wide variety of fields. This course aims to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of data assimilation without assuming a background in mathematical concepts or any specialist subject knowledge*
  
 - [Climate Intelligence: Using Climate Data to Improve Business Decision-Making](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-intelligence-using-climate-data-to-improve-business-decision-making) 

 *Climate and weather projections hold the data that businesses need both to evaluate the risk climate change poses and to mitigate that risk. However, interpreting this data can be challenging.
On this two-week course, youâ€™ll learn how to identify relevant and reliable climate data for your business and explore how that raw data can be converted into information that connects with the particular operational and financial decisions you face* 

In addition, there are [4 term-long scheduled online courses](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/online-courses/classes), with start dates in October, January and April. These are offered in
